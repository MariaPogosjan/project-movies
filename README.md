# Project Movies
In this week's project we focused on how to make react apps with multiple pages using routes. In this app, we've used an API to fetch popular movies in the US. 

## The problem

We started by fetching all the data from the API that we wanted to use in our page. In the same time we created different components for the different pages. Once we finished that we started to build multi-page applications using React Router. When we finished the general requirements, we added more pages and components to our page. We also added some features to get our app to be more user friendly. If we had more time, we would add more energy to the styling for the filter button on the first page and do a better responsiveness for mobile and tablet.
